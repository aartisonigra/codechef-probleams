The Whitespace Gotcha in JSX
In JSX, whitespace does not always behave the same way as it does in HTML. By default, JSX does not automatically add spaces between elements, which can sometimes lead to unexpected results.

For example, let's say we have the following JSX code:

Understanding the Issue
When we write JSX, we might assume that if we put a variable right next to some text, a space will appear automatically. But JSX treats text nodes and variables as separate elements, and it does not insert spaces between them.

On IDE, you can see an example where the missing space issue occurs.

The output will be
Incorrect: Days left:30

As you can see, the number appears right next to the colon (:) without a space. JSX is rendering them as separate elements without inserting any whitespace.

Solution: Adding Explicit Whitespace
To fix this issue, we need to explicitly add a space inside curly braces ({' '}), which tells JSX that we want an actual space in the output.

Corrected Code

const element = (
  <div>
    <strong>Days left:</strong>
    {' '}
    {eventDays}
  </div>
);
Now, the output will be correctly displayed as:
Days left: 30

Why Does This Happen?
JSX is not HTMLâ€”it compiles to JavaScript using React.createElement().
Spaces between elements are not automatically included unless explicitly added.
{' '} is used to manually insert whitespace, ensuring the proper format.


SOLUTIONS:

const eventDays = 30;

export function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <strong>Days left:</strong>{' '}
      {eventDays}
    </div>
  );
}

Task - Dynamic Greeting Card
Update the given React component to display dynamic values and additional information inside the <div>.

Show dynamic values:

Add a <p> tag to display:
<p>Hello, my name is {name}.</p>  
Add another <p> tag to show age:
<p>I am {age} years old.</p>  
Display the current year dynamically:

Use JavaScript inside JSX to show the year:
<p>Year: {new Date().getFullYear()}</p>  
Add a final message:

Insert this at the end:
<p>Enjoy your day! ðŸŽ‰</p>  


SOLUTIONS:

export function App() {  
    // Defining dynamic values
    const name = "John"; 
    const age = 25; 
    const greeting = "Happy Birthday!";  

    // Styling
    const cardStyle = {
        border: "2px solid #333", 
        padding: "20px", 
        borderRadius: "10px", 
        width: "250px",
        textAlign: "center",
        boxShadow: "2px 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"
    }; 

    const headingStyle = {
        color: "blue",
        fontSize: "20px"
    };

    return (  
        <div style={cardStyle}>
            {/* Greeting message */}
            <h2 style={headingStyle}>{greeting}</h2>  

            {/* Displaying dynamic values */}
            <p>Hello, my name is {name}.</p>
            <p>I am {age} years old.</p>

            {/* Current year using JS expression */}
            <p>Year: {new Date().getFullYear()}</p>

            {/* Final message */}
            <p>Enjoy your day! ðŸŽ‰</p>
        </div>  
    );  
}
