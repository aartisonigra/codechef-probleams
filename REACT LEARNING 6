Map() Method in Javascript
The map() method is used to create a new array by transforming each item of an existing array using a function you provide. It's like telling JavaScript: “Hey, go through this array, do something to each item, and give me back a new array with the results.” The original array stays untouched, which is great when you want to transform data without modifying the source.

Example 1: Implicit Return

let numbers = [5, 10, 15];

let divided = numbers.map(num => num / 5);

console.log(divided); // Output - [1, 2, 3]
In this example, we're dividing each number by 5. Since the arrow function is a single line without curly braces, it automatically returns the result. This is called an implicit return, and it's perfect for short, simple operations.

Example 2: Explicit Return

let nums = [1, 2, 3];

let doubled = nums.map(n => {
  return n * 2;
});

console.log(doubled); // Output -  [2, 4, 6]
Here, the arrow function uses curly braces, which means we need to use the return keyword. This is useful when your logic is more than one line or when you want to keep things consistent.

Example 3: Transforming Objects

let users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Ava' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Ben' }
];

let userInfo = users.map(user => ({
  userId: user.id,
  userName: user.name
}));

console.log(userInfo);
// Output - [ { userId: 1, userName: 'Ava' }, { userId: 2, userName: 'Ben' } ]
In this case, we're working with an array of objects. The map() method creates a new array where each object has a different structure. Since we're returning an object directly, we wrap it in parentheses to avoid confusion with a function block. This is a common use case in real apps—reshaping data before displaying it on a UI.

Key Takeaways

map() always returns a new array.
It doesn't modify the original array.
Use implicit return for simple expressions.
Use explicit return if you're using curly braces or need multiple lines.
It's especially powerful for transforming arrays of objects, like reshaping API data or preparing things for display.

QESTIONS:

Square the Numbers
You are given an array of integers. Your task is to create a new array where each element is the square of the original array's elements using the map() function.

SOLUTIONs:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using map() to square each number
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * number); 

console.log(squaredNumbers);


Explanation:
The map() function iterates through each element of the numbers array.

For each element, it applies the function number => number * number, which squares the element.

The result is stored in squaredNumbers, and when you log it, it will print [1, 4, 9, 16, 25].

Convert Array of Strings to Uppercase Using map()
You are given an array of strings. Your task is to create a new array where each string is converted to its uppercase(use toUpperCase function) version. You must use the .map() method to achieve this.

INPUT:
['hello', 'world', 'javascript']

OUTPUT:
[ 'HELLO', 'WORLD', 'JAVASCRIPT' ]


OUTPUT:
const words = ['hello', 'world', 'javascript'];
const uppercaseWords = words.map(word => word.toUpperCase());
console.log(uppercaseWords);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Destructuring Nested Arrays of Objects
You have an array of objects, where each object represents a product with a name and price. Your goal is to create a new array containing only the price of each product. You must use the .map() method.

Sample 1:
Input
Output
[
  { name: 'Laptop', price: 1200 },
  { name: 'Mouse', price: 25 },
  { name: 'Keyboard', price: 75 }
]
[ 1200, 25, 75 ]

SOLUTIONS:

const products = [
  { name: 'Laptop', price: 1200 },
  { name: 'Mouse', price: 25 },
  { name: 'Keyboard', price: 75 }
];
//PRODUCT CONTAINS OBJECTS
//name : name of the products { name: 'Laptop', price: 1200 },
//price: the price of the products(e.g., 1200, 25, 75).

// complete the code 
const prices = products.map(({price}) => price);
//map() : is an array method that create a new array by applying a given funcation to each elemts of the aaray
console.log(prices);

//Destructuring: ({ price }) is using object destructuring to directly extract the price property from each object in the array.
//Arrow function (=>): ({ price }) => price is an arrow function that takes an object, extracts the price property, and returns it.
