CALLBACK FUNCATION

-what is a callback funcation?

In React, a callback function is a function that is passed as a prop to a child component from a parent component, so the child can call it and communicate back to the parent.

This is useful when the parent needs to be informed or take action based on what happens inside the child component.


import React from 'react';
import Child from './Child';

function Parent() {
  const handleMessage = (msg) => {
    alert("Message from child: " + msg);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <Child onSendMessage={handleMessage} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Parent;
